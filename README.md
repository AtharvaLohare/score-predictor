# Student Exam Performance Predictor

This project predicts a student's math score based on their background and test scores using a machine learning model. It has a web interface built with Flask where you can enter details and get a prediction.

## How it works

- Fill out a form on the website with info like gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test prep, reading and writing scores.
- The app processes your input, runs it through a trained ML model, and shows you the predicted math score.


## What's inside

- **Flask app:** Handles the website and user input.
- **ML pipeline:** Code for data processing, training, and prediction.
- **Templates:** HTML files for the web pages.
- **Artifacts:** The trained model and preprocessor.

## Why this project?

I wanted to learn how to connect machine learning with a web interface. I'm new to Flask and web stuff, so this project helped me understand how to organize code and make a simple ML web app.
